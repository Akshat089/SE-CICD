## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses **Jenkins** for continuous integration and deployment automation.

### Pipeline Stages:

1. **📥 Checkout** - Pulls code from GitHub
2. **🔨 Build** - Verifies Python environment and application structure
3. **🧪 Test** - Runs unit tests to ensure code quality
4. **🐳 Build Docker Image** - Creates containerized application
5. **📤 Push to Docker Hub** - Uploads image to Docker repository
6. **✅ Verify** - Confirms successful image creation

### Pipeline Configuration:

The `Jenkinsfile` is configured to:
- Automatically trigger on code commits
- Run on both Windows and Unix environments
- Use Docker Hub credentials securely
- Tag images with build numbers and 'latest'
